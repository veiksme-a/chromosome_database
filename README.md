This project was a group assignment to create a human chromosome browser using a GenBank file containing information on multiple loci present in the chromosome. The project consisted of three tiers: a database with the genomic information, a web-based graphical user interface and a connecting middle layer. I was responsible for creating the database and APIs to connect it to other layers.
A relational database stores data from a standard Genbank format, i.e. loci information (accession, chromosomal sequence, sequence, etc.) with corresponding CDS data (genes, products, nucleotide and amino acid sequences, etc.). It also contains codon usage data for the entire chromosome and restriction sites for common restriction enzymes.
In order to load the information into the database, I created a parser that can extract the required data from the Genbank file and convert it into SQL, as well as calculators for codon usage and restriction sites. A Python wrapper to the SQL was written to return the data required by the user.
